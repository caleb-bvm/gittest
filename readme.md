# 2-Player Breakout Game

A simple 2-player web-based game inspired by the classic Breakout/Arkanoid. Each player controls a paddle to hit the ball. If a player misses the ball, they lose a life. The game ends when one player loses all their lives.

## Features
- **Two Players:** Player 1 controls the left paddle, and Player 2 controls the right paddle.
- **Scoring:** Players score points when the opponent misses the ball.
- **Lives:** Each player starts with 3 lives.
- **Winning Condition:** The player who still has lives when the other player loses all their lives wins.

## How to Play
1. **Player 1 Controls:** Use `W` (up) and `S` (down) to move the left paddle.
2. **Player 2 Controls:** Use the `Arrow Up` and `Arrow Down` keys to move the right paddle.
3. **Objective:** Hit the ball with your paddle. If the ball goes past your paddle, you lose a life.
4. **Game Over:** The game ends when one player loses all 3 lives.
